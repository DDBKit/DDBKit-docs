**Options** are the parameters to commands. If your command needs input from the user, like a string, another user,
a role, a boolean, whatever, use options.

```swift
.addingOptions {
	UserOption(name: "target", description: "The target user to ban")
		.required()
	IntOption(name: "days", description: "Days of messages to delete")
		.range(1...2)
	BoolOption(name: "roles", description: "Whether to give them roles back on join")
}
```

You access and get options from an `InteractionExtras` object, which is given in a command's closure, or component closure.

```swift
...
guard let target = await interaction.getUser(from: "target") else { return }
...
```
