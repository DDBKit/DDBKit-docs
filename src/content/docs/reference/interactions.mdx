## Supplying default values

For nullable options which aren't required,
you should gracefully handle them instead of
force unwrapping. For example, null coalesce
with a default value:

```swift
i.getString(from: "food") ?? "banana"
```

If the option is required, there is nothing
wrong with force unwrapping:

```swift
i.getString(from: "food")!
```

## Deferring

A common process when responding to the user
is waiting for an API to respond or doing some
other work which takes time. Discord will discard
your interaction if you take too long, so you should
signal that you need to get work done by deferring
the interaction:

```swift ".deferredChannelMessageWithSource()"
Command("cook") { i in
	try await i.respond(with: .deferredChannelMessageWithSource())
	try await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(5))
	try await i.editResponse(with: "Cooked \(i.getString(from: "food")!)")
}
.addingOptions {
	StringOption(name: "food", description: "some food")
		.required()
}
```
