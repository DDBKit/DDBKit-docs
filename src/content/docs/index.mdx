	<Card title="Powerful" icon="rocket">
		DDBKit provides a clean and concise
		ResultBuilder-based API to Discord,
		eliminating unnecessary boilerplate code.
		```swift
		Message {
			MessageContent {
				Heading("gm")
				Text("gm")
			}
			MessageComponents {
				ActionRow {
					LinkButton("Get Started", url: "...")
						.id("mom-btn")
				}
			}
		}
		```
	</Card>
	<Card title="Fast" icon="seti:swift">
		Thanks to the safety and performance
		of Swift, your Discord bots respond
		rapidly and efficiently. Each event
		is ran on it’s own `Task` context
		without blocking your main thread,
		and ensuring smooth operation.
		
		[DiscordBM][discordbm] exposes
		fully-typed and asynchronous access
		to the entire Discord API.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Extensive" icon="setting">
		DDBKit covers everything, from the entrypoint
		of your bot and it’s initialisation to easy
		creation of messages, embeds, components
		and modals.
	</Card>
	<Card title="And more" icon="open-book">
		DDBKit ships with two support modules,
		`DDBKitUtilitites` and `DDBKitFoundation`
		to help increase productivity.
