<Card title="Powerful" icon="rocket">
	DDBKit provides a clean and concise ResultBuilder-based API to Discord, eliminating unnecessary boilerplate code.
	<Code lang="swift" code={landingExampleCode} />
</Card>

<Card title="Fast" icon="seti:swift">
	Thanks to the safety and performance of Swift, your Discord bots respond rapidly and efficiently.
	Each event is ran on it's own `Task` context without blocking your main thread, and ensuring smooth operation.

	[DiscordBM](https://github.com/DiscordBM/DiscordBM) exposes fully-typed access to the Discord API with everything async/await.
</Card>

<Card title="Extensive" icon="setting">
	DDBKit covers everything, from the entrypoint of your bot and it's initialisation to easy creation of messages, embeds, components and modals.
</Card>

<Card title="And more" icon="open-book">
	DDBKit ships with two support modules, `DDBKitUtilitites` and `DDBKitFoundation` to help increase productivity.
</Card>
