title: Handling events
---

Discord signals events when certain things happen,
such as when your bot is ready to go, or when a
message is created. These are specified in your
bot's body in DDBKit:

```swift
// Bot.swift
@main
struct App: DiscordBotApp {
	// ...
	var body: [any BotScene] {
		ReadyEvent { ready in
			print("hi mom")
		}
		MessageCreateEvent { msg in
			print("[\(msg.author?.username ?? "unknown")] \(msg.content)")
		}
		GuildMemberUpdateEvent { member in
			print("\(member.user.username) changed")
		}
	}
	// ...
}
```

DDBKit implements every event, and there are way
too many to list. The good news is, the API for
each one is almost identical.
