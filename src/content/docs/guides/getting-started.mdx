This will guide you through the basics of
setting up DDBKit and your bot. By the end,
we should have something that can connect
to Discord, and you can work from there afterward.

## Prerequisites
* A decent understanding of the Swift programming language.
* A Discord bot. Click [here][developer-portal] to make one.
* Something that can compile Swift code. macOS and Linux are preferred.
Get Swift [here](https://www.swift.org/install/).
:::tip
A great place to start learning Swift is the 
[Swift book](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/).<br />
You can also use the [Swift Guided Tour](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour)
for a quick introduction to the language.
:::
:::note
On macOS, using Xcode for DDBKit development is recommended.<br />
It offers Swift-oriented features to make editing code easier.<br />
For easier version management, it is recommended that you use 
[Xcodes](https://github.com/XcodesOrg/XcodesApp/releases/latest).
:::

## Setting up a package

Open up your terminal and create a new Swift package, this
will be your bot:

```sh
mkdir bot
cd bot
swift package init --name Bot --type executable
```

You will now have the following:

<FileTree>
	- bot
		- Package.swift
		- Sources
			- Bot
				- Bot.swift
</FileTree>

You can open this directory in your editor of choice for
the rest of this guide. Or do it all from the terminal if
you're into that.

### Tweaking `Package.swift`
:::caution[Important]
The `swift-tools-version` in `Package.swift` will vary depending
on what Swift version you have installed, so you'll need to
change it to 5.10 in order for DDBKit to work.
:::

...so change the version number accordingly:

```diff lang="swift"
// Package.swift
-// swift-tools-version: 6.2
+// swift-tools-version: 5.10
```

...and also add DDBKit as a dependency:

```diff lang="swift"
let package = Package(
	name: "Bot",
+	dependencies: [
+		.package(url: "https://github.com/DDBKit/DDBKit.git", branch: "main")
+	],
	targets: [
		.executableTarget(
			name: "Bot",
+			dependencies: [
+				.product(name: "DDBKit", package: "DDBKit"),
+				.product(name: "DDBKitUtilities", package: "DDBKit")
+			]
		),
	]
)
```

## Setting up an entry point
The entry point is where we specify the token and
intents and some other things. Open `Sources/Bot/Bot.swift`
and replace the contents with:

```swift "TOKEN HERE"
import DDBKit
import Foundation

@main
struct Bot: DiscordBotApp {
	init() async {
		bot = await BotGatewayManager(
			token: "TOKEN HERE",
			intents: []
		)
		cache = await .init(
			gatewayManager: bot,
			intents: .all,
			requestAllMembers: .enabledWithPresences,
			messageCachingPolicy: .saveEditHistoryAndDeleted
		)
	}

	var body: [any BotScene] {
		ReadyEvent { ready in
			print("hi mom")
		}
		MessageCreateEvent { msg in
			print("[\(msg.author?.username ?? "unknown")] \(msg.content)")
		}
	}

	var bot: Bot
	var cache: Cache
}
```

The specifics of this don't really matter yet, for right
now, just replace "TOKEN HERE" with your bot's token.

:::caution[Important]
Don't commit or share your token. Properly store it
in a .env or config.json file (for example) and add
that file to your .gitignore.

See the [FAQ](/more/faq/) if you want an example of
storing secrets.

## Running the bot
A universal way of doing so is to run this in your bot's directory:

```sh
swift run
```

### In an IDE
For Xcode, hit the play button at the top left. For
other editors, it can vary.

### In production
If you finished your bot and want to deploy it, there's
many ways to do so.
The [template](https://github.com/DDBKit/DDBKit-Template) provides
a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml if you'd like to use Docker.
Also consider systemd/launchd services.

If you need to compile your bot, run `swift build -c release`.
