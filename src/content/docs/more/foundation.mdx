DDBKitFoundation is a module that provides extra
utilities to cover generic boilerplate work, in
the form of many extensions. It offers a number
of pre-built interactive commands for end-users
to discover your bot and easily configure it. It
also offers an easy-to-use way of configuration
since handling configuration is done by the
extension itself, you just need to provide the
available properties for configuration and read
configuration values as needed.

## Setup - `Configurator`

To use DDBKitFoundation, you need to import the
module into your project.

```swift
// Remember to use @_spi to access extensions.
@_spi(Extensions) import DDBKitFoundation
```

Register the `Configurator` extension in your bot app.

```swift
@main
struct MyNewBot: DiscordBotApp {
	init() async {
		// ...
	}

	func onBoot() async throws {
		// we pass in the configuration template type to the configurator instance
		let configExtension = Configurator(guildConfiguation: GuildConfigTemplate.self)
		RegisterExtension(configExtension)
	}
}

// ... elsewhere

struct GuildConfigTemplate: ConfigTemplate {
	@Config(name: "prefix", description: "The prefix for the bot", initialValue: "!")
	var prefix: String
}
```

And with that, basic setup is done! `Configurator`
has added <code type="cmd">/config guild</code> to
your bot, which allows members of a guild with the
**Manage Server** permission to configure the bot's
prefix.

The kicker is that you don't need to worry about the
configuration process or storage, you can just read
the configuration values as needed during the bot's
lifecycle.

:::tip
`Configurator` will automatically create more subcommands
for types of `ConfigurationTemplate` that you provide in
the initialiser. <br /> Available template parameters
include:

* guildConfiguration
* channelConfiguration
* memberConfiguration
* roleConfiguration
* userConfiguration
  These should cover all the bases for your bot's
  configuration needs.

DDBKitFoundation will have more features in the future!
