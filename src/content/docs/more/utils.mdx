# Extensions

DDBKitUtilities exposes a collection of
useful extensions for your Discord bots.

## BucketRatelimiting

Your Discord bot may have a number of commands
that use expensive resources or external service
limits. To prevent abuse, you can use the
`BucketRatelimiting` extension to rate limit
these commands.

To get started, register the extension at boot.

```swift
@_spi(Extensions) import DDBKitUtilities

struct MyNewBot: DiscordBotApp {
	func onBoot() async throws {
		// ...
		RegisterExtension(BucketRatelimiting())
	}
}
```

You can now use the `ratelimited()` modifier on
your commands to rate limit them.

```swift
Command("ratelimited") { i in
	try await i.respond(with: "This command is rate limited!")
}
.ratelimited()
```

You can customise it by passing in a configuration
object.

```swift
Command("ratelimited") { i in
	try await i.respond(with: "This command is rate limited!")
}
.ratelimited(.init(maxUses: 10, timeWindow: 60))
```

The example above would rate limit the command to
10 uses per minute.

# Builders

DDBKitUtilities provides a collection of utiltity
builders for various structured types. This allows
for a more concise and readable way to instance
these types.

## Message builder

You can build a simple message with text content
with the `Message` struct.

### Text Content

```swift
Message {
	Text("Hello World!")
}
```

> `MessageContentComponent` types such as `Text` can
> be used at the root of a `Message` builder to set
> the message content easily.

### Text Formatting

The following example demonstrates many of the
available modifiers and components.

```swift
Message {
	Heading {
		Text {
			Text("Welcome to ")
			Text("The Test")
				.italic()
			Text("!")
		}.underlined()
	}
	Heading("We're testing the Message DSL")
		.medium()
	Text("Actually scratch that")
		.strikethrough()
	Link("https://llsc12.me")
		.disableEmbedding()
		.maskedWith {
			Text("check out this!")
				.bold()
		}
	Blockquote {
		Heading {
			Text("Blockquote!")
				.underlined()
		}.medium()
		Text("yep, we got em")
	}
}
```
