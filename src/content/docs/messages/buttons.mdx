**Buttons** are clickable elements you can append to a message. In DDBKit, you put them
inside an ActionRow inside a components disclosure. Buttons have 4 styles. Each button
has a unique ID which is to identify which was clicked by the user.

```swift
Message {
	MessageContent {
		Text("Are you sure?")
	}
	MessageComponents {
		ActionRow {
			Button("Yes")
				.id("yes")
				.style(.danger)
			Button("No")
				.id("no")
				.style(.primary)
		}
	}
}
```
