**Messages** are.. messages. They can contain many things- markdown, components like buttons, reactions, embeds,
attachments, stickers, whatever.
DDBKit provides an interface for all of this and more. Messages are constructed intuitively with builders.

```swift
Message {
	MessageContent {
		Heading("Some information")
		Text("This is to the:")

		List {
			Text("crazy ones")
			Text("misfits")
			Text("rebels")
			Text("troublemakers")
			Text("round pegs in the square holes")
		}

		Subtext("""
		They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo.
		""")
	}
}.ephemeral()
```
