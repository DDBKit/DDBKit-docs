**Components** are interactive elements you can add to a message, for when you need more than just
simple text. You use them for user input, say,
choosing a user to ban with a drop-down, a confirmation of an action with buttons, or selecting roles
to receive with a drop-down. Or, you can present information in an organized manner with embeds.

```swift
Message {
	MessageEmbed {
		Title("True or False")
		Description("The Eiffel Tower can shrink in winter due to the cold.")
		Image(.exact("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Tour_Eiffel_Wikimedia_Commons_%28cropped%29.jpg"))
	}.setColor(.gray)
	MessageComponents {
		ActionRow {
			Button("✅")
				.style(.success)
			Button("❌")
				.style(.danger)
		}
	}
}
```
