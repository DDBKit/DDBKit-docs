## Prerequisites
This guide assumes you have decent understanding of the Swift language and something to compile a Swift project on.

You also need a Discord bot. [Create one here.](https://discord.com/developers/applications?new_application=true)

## Getting the template
Download/clone the template [here](https://github.com/DDBKit/DDBKit-Template/). However you set it up is your
choice and out of scope for this guide. Typically, you should just download & unzip this repository, and open
it in Xcode.

## Filling out the token
Take a look at `Sources/Bot.swift`. Notice line 17:

```swift
token: [Token Goes Here],
```

You should replace this with your bot's token. This can be found in [the portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications),
under your app, **Bot** > **Reset Token**. **Never share this.**

Once you've done this, the bot is ready to run. Run it however you'd like, whether that be the run button
in Xcode, or using something like Docker.

## What next?
Just experiment! Make something. Take a look at how the template works and what else you can do with it.

If you want to make more commands, messages, or whatever, read on.
