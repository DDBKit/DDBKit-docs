DDBKit is built on top of DiscordBM, a library that provides a high-level API for Discord bots. 
You may need to use DiscordBM directly for most functionality not covered by DDBKit.

You can use the `bot` instance which is of type `GatewayManager` to interact with Discord directly.
You can access the `client` property on `bot` to get the underlying `DiscordClient` instance to make HTTP requests.

```swift
Command("disappearing") { i in
  let msgres = try await bot.client.createMessage(channelId: i.interaction.channel_id!, payload: .init(content: "I will disappear in 3 seconds"))
    .decode()
  
  try await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(3))
  try await bot.client.deleteMessage(channelId: msgres.channel_id, messageId: msgres.id)
    .guardSuccess()
}
```

The above example demonstrates using the Discord API directly to create and delete a message.

Refer to [DiscordBM](https://github.com/DiscordBM/DiscordBM)'s documentation for more information on how to use the library.
