DDBKit (**D**eclarative **D**iscord **B**ot Kit) is an abstraction for [DiscordBM](https://github.com/DiscordBM/DiscordBM).
It allows you to build bots in a new, more simple, and friendly way. Your project is structured similarly to that of a SwiftUI
project, the same goes for the code. Things like commands and messages or embeds are laid out in a more understandable way,
and you can easily iterate and customize with a human-friendly, declarative format. DDBKit and your bot use Swift to harness
the power of Swift's [result builder](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0289-result-builders.md) functionality.

```swift
Message {
  MessageContent {
    Text("Hello, world!")
  }
}
```

This section covers the setup and configuration of your bot.
By the end, you will have a fully configured bot capable of 
connecting to Discord and supporting slash commands, along 
with additional functionality.
