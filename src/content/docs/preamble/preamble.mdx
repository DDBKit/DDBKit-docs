DDBKit, short for Declarative Discord Bot Kit,
simplifies the process of building Discord bots
by abstracting Discord's API. Inspired by SwiftUI,
DDBKit allows you to declare commands and apply
modifiers to create bot functionality with ease.
It operates similarly to [Commando][commando]
and is built on top of [DiscordBM][discordbm].

This section covers the setup and configuration of
your bot. By the end, you will have a fully
configured bot capable of connecting to Discord
and supporting slash commands, along with additional
functionality.

P.S. If you love DDBKit, consider
