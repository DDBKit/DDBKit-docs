<Aside type="danger">
The extensions API provided by DDBKit is not API stable and will change in the future.
Try not to make production-level extension since it may break in future versions.

This note does not apply to v1.x versions of DDBKit.
</Aside>

Extensions are a very powerful resource in DDBKit that allows you to incorporate middleware functionality into your bot interactions.

There are two ways to use extensions:
- Registering a `DDBKitExtension` type to your `BotInstance`.
- Using modifiers exposed by the extension to intercept commands.
And you can combine both to create a powerful extension that can do a lot of things.

<Aside type="tip">
Using or making an extension requires that you use the `@_spi` attribute to access the relevant APIs for extensions.
```swift
// Regular users: Import the module with 
// the extension you need with `@_spi`.
@_spi(Extensions) import DDBKitFoundation

// Extension developers: Use the `@_spi` attribute
// to gain access to the APIs you need.
@_spi(Extensions) import DDBKit
// ...
```
</Aside>

## Registering an extension

This is important to all end-users of extensions. If you need to use an extension that acts on a global level,
you need to add some code to your bot app that runs on startup.

```swift
@main
struct MyNewBot: DiscordBotApp {
  init() async {
    // ...
  }

  func boot() async throws {
    // Register the extension
    RegisterExtension(MyExtension())
  }
}
```

When your bot launches, the extension will be registered and will be able to intercept commands, as well as adding and removing commands and events.

<Aside type="caution">
**Third-party extensions can be dangerous.**<br />
Make sure you trust the source of the extension before using it in your bot.
Extensions can **access all data** in your bot, **including tokens**.
In the end, using a Swift package is running someone else's code on your machine, always be cautious.
</Aside>

## Using extension modifiers

This is important to all end-users of extensions. This is for using an extension-provided modifier that acts on a command-scope.

Extensions can expose modifiers that can intercept actions of the command they're attached to.

<Aside>
Modifiers may require their global extensions to be registered to work properly.<br />
Check with the extension's documentation to see if this is the case.
</Aside>

Check out this example of a hypothetical extension modifier:
```swift
Command("ping") { i in
  // ...
}
.levelRequirement(at: 20) // has to be xp level 20 to use the command
```

In this hypothetical example, the `levelRequirement` modifier is provided by an extension and will only allow the command to be executed if the user has an XP level of 20 or higher.
The modifier can throw early if the requirement is not met, plus they could add their own error handling too, but that wouldn't be cool.

Maybe the modifier requires its extension to be registered for storing and retrieving XP levels.

## Example extension ideas

- **XP System**: An extension that tracks user XP and levels, from messages ***and*** command interactions.
- **Moderation**: An extension that layers a permission system for moderation commands where your server consists of different rankings rather than moderator and admin.
- **Logging**: An extension that logs all events, commands and interactions to a database for later review.
- **Custom Commands**: An extension that aggregates some data and creates a command to view that data.
- **Ratelimiting**: An extension that limits the number of commands a user can run in a certain time frame or bucket.

<Aside type="tip">
DDBKit comes with two built-in extensions that may be convenient to most people.<br />
[**DDBKitUtilities**](/extras/ddbkitutilities) provides some extension modifiers for bucket-based ratelimiting and other utilities.<br />
[**DDBKitFoundation**](/extras/ddbkitfoundation) provides a complete solution for bots that need initial configuration and setup, plus automatic guild and member preferences storage, retrieval and commands.
</Aside>

A Discord bot could encapsulate functionality and behaviour to be more modular, or just be a drop-in system.
It depends on your preference and goals. 

## Creating an extension

<Aside type="tip">
Making an extension? Cool! If you feel like open-sourcing it, be sure to tag the repo with **DDBKit** so others can find it!

### Registerable Extension

To create an extension, you need to create an actor that conforms to the `DDBKitExtension` protocol.

```swift
actor MyExtension: DDBKitExtension {
  func onBoot(_ instance: inout BotInstance) async throws {
    // ...
  }
}
```
<Aside type="note">
Actors are a feature in Swift that allows you to create objects that can be interacted with concurrently.
This is useful for extensions, as they can be interacted with by multiple parts of the bot at the same time.
The actor system prevents simultaneous access to the same data, which can cause a crash. Extensions are accessed
from many concurrent contexts since commands run in different `Task`s.
</Aside>

From in this `onBoot(_:)` function, you can interact with `BotInstance`, which is the main class behind the user's Discord bot.
It contains a bunch of useful properties and functions that you can use to interact with the bot.<br />
The `onBoot(_:)` function is called when `BotInstance` finishes setting up the environment and is ready to start the bot. 
It then calls the function of all registered extensions in the order they were registered.

Here's the interface of `BotInstance`:

```swift
public class BotInstance {
  public var globalErrorHandle: ((any GatewayManager, any Error, Interaction) async throws -> Void)?

  public var events: [any BaseEvent]

  public var commands: [ExtensibleCommand]

  public var modalReceives: [String : [(Interaction, Interaction.ModalSubmit, DatabaseBranches) async throws -> Void]]

  public var componentReceives: [String : [(Interaction, Interaction.MessageComponent, DatabaseBranches) async throws -> Void]]

  /// Unique stable identifier for the app
  public let id: ApplicationSnowflake
}
```

If you didn't already notice `inout`, it means you've been passed a reference to the `BotInstance`, 
and you can modify it directly and your changes will be reflected in the original instance.

Here's an example to print all registered commands.

```swift
actor PrintAllCommandsExtension: DDBKitExtension {
  func onBoot(_ instance: inout BotInstance) async throws {
    let registeredCommands = instance.commands.map(\.baseInfo.name)
    print(registeredCommands)
  }
}
```

You can edit the commands from here too, such as adding new commands, 
removing commands, or modifying existing commands.

```swift
actor PrintAllCommandsExtension: DDBKitExtension {
  func onBoot(_ instance: inout BotInstance) async throws {
    instance.commands = instance.commands.map {
      $0
        .preAction { cmd, _ in
          print(cmd.baseInfo.name)
        }
        .postAction { cmd, _ in
          print(cmd.baseInfo.name, "finished") // if it didnt error this will work
        }
    }
  }
}
```

`DDBKitExtension` has two more methods called at other times.

```swift
actor PrintAllCommandsExtension: DDBKitExtension {
  func onBoot(_ instance: inout BotInstance) async throws {
    // ...
  }

  /// The register method allows you to create new commands and events
  /// This builder can use logic to determine what to register, which you
  /// can combine with `onBoot(:) async throws` to logically add handling.
  func register() -> [any BotScene] {
    Command("gm") { e in
      try await e.respond(with: "gm")
    }
  }

  /// Gives you direct events from the gateway. Combine this with
  /// DiscordBM's `GatewayEventHandler` protocol to make event handling easier
  func onEvent(_ instance: BotInstance, event: Gateway.Event) async throws {
    print("\(event.type ?? "") received")
    // instanciate handler with event and handle
    MessageReceiveHandle(event: event).handle() 
  }


  struct MessageReceiveHandle: GatewayEventHandler {
    var event: Gateway.Event
    
    func onMessageCreate(_ payload: Gateway.MessageCreate) async throws {
      print("[\(payload.author?.username ?? "idk")] \(payload.content)")
    }
  }
}
```

### Modifiers

To create a modifier, you just extend `ExtensibleCommand` with new methods that return type `Self`.

Here's some of the interface for `ExtensibleCommand`:

```swift
extension ExtensibleCommand {
    public func preAction(_ action: @escaping (BaseContextCommand, any GatewayManager, DiscordCache, Interaction, DatabaseBranches) async throws -> Void) -> Self

    public func postAction(_ action: @escaping (BaseContextCommand, any GatewayManager, DiscordCache, Interaction, DatabaseBranches) async throws -> Void) -> Self

    public func catchAction(_ action: @escaping (any Error, BaseContextCommand, any GatewayManager, DiscordCache, Interaction, DatabaseBranches) async throws -> Void) -> Self

    public func boot(_ action: @escaping (BaseContextCommand, BotInstance) async throws -> Void) -> Self
}
```

You can combine these modifiers inside of your own modifier to create a chain of actions that will be executed as part of an interaction.
The `boot` modifier runs your closure immediately after extension registering finishes 
so you can do initial setup if needed, allowing you to work with a global extension instance.

Here's an example of a modifier that prints something before and after a command is run:

```swift
extension ExtensibleCommand {
  func logUsages() -> Self {
    self
      .boot { cmd, _ in
        print("\(cmd.baseInfo.name) command exists!")
      }
      .catchAction { error, cmd, _, _, i, _ in
        print("\(cmd.baseInfo.name) command errored for \(i.interaction.member?.user?.username ?? "unknown user") with error: \(error)")
      }
      .preAction { cmd, _, _, i, _ in
        print("\(cmd.baseInfo.name) command started by \(i.interaction.member?.user?.username ?? "unknown user")")
      }
      .postAction { cmd, _, _, i, _ in
        print("\(cmd.baseInfo.name) command completed for \(i.interaction.member?.user?.username ?? "unknown user")")
      }
  }
}
```

This modifier will print the command name when the bot boots, 
when the command is started, when the command is completed, and when the command errors.

```swift
Command("failable") { i, _, _ in
  struct Egg: Decodable {
    var gm: String
  }
  let data = "{}".data(using: .utf8)!
  _ = try JSONDecoder().decode(Egg.self, from: data)
}
.integrationType(.all, contexts: .all)
.logUsages()
```

In this example, this command will fail, and the modifier will print the command name, 
the user who started the command, and the error it threw. The postAction will not run in this case.

You can then combine all of the above with your existing skills to make a powerful extension that'll help make people's bots better.

#### Modifier utilities

You may need to interact with your global extension from within a modifier, 
but you can't store a reference to it anywhere that you can access easily.

To solve this, DDBKit exposes some utilities, one of which can pull a reference from the `BotInstance`
for you quickly and easily.

```swift
// In your modifier
extension ExtensibleCommand {
  func myModifier() -> Self {
    self
      .boot { cmd, i in
        let myExtension = i.instance[ext: Configurator.self]
        myExtension.doSomething()
      }
  }
}
```

### `InteractionExtras` Extensions

`InteractionExtras` is the structure passed into all interaction closures in DDBKit, 
which exposes it's wrapped `Interaction` structure and a reference to the `BotInstance`.
It's extended with computed properties to expose the gateway and cache objects, and 
you can extend it with your own properties and methods for your extension.

```swift
public extension InteractionExtras {
  // Does a thing in MyExtension with the interaction
  func doSomething() async throws {
    let ext = self.instance[ext: MyExtension.self]
    try await ext.doSomething(self)
  }
}
```

You can now expose methods and properties from `InteractionExtras` to your extension for users.
