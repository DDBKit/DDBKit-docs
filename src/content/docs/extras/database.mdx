<Aside type="danger">
  This database is very basic and not suited for large-scale applications.<br />
  For larger scale use, consider using something like [GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift).<br />
  For really large scale use, consider using a dedicated database server combined with one of Vapor's database packages.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note">
You may wish to just use the database module for storing basic data like preferences of users or guilds, 
or for storing other small-scale data that doesn't need to be queried in complex ways. In this case,
the database module is adequate for your needs, as it also ensures that collisions are avoided.

Using the database is straight forward, and a utility structure is passed into commands by default that 
exposes predefined database requests based on interaction context.

You use the database by accessing the singleton instance of it.

```swift
import Database

let db = Database.shared
```

The database stores models, which are structs that conform to `DatabaseModel` (it's just `Codable`).

```swift
struct UserPrefs: DatabaseModel {
  /// Whether the user likes cheese or not
  var theyReallyLikeCheese: Bool
  /// The user's XP points
  var xp: UInt

  // helpful for setting default values quickly
  static var `default`: UserPrefs { 
    UserPrefs(theyReallyLikeCheese: false, xp: 0)
  }
}
```

You can then use the database to store and retrieve data in the format of said models.

```swift
// in your bot

Command("cheese") { i in
  // defer, since database operations can be held up by other accesses
  try await i.respond(with: .deferredChannelMessageWithSource())
  // get option data
  let bool = try i.options.requireOption(named: "bool").requireBool()
  // get the user's prefs, this means it shares across servers.
  let req = i.dbRequests.user(ofType: UserPrefs.self)
  let prefs = try await db.transaction() { prefs in
    var prefs = prefs ?? .default // if the user doesn't have prefs, use default
    prefs.theyReallyLikeCheese = bool
    return prefs // return modified prefs to be saved
  }! // force unwrap, we know it exists
  // the prefs returned from the transaction are the updated prefs we returned from the closure
  // so we can use them here in the response.
  try await i.respond {
    Message {
      MessageEmbed {
        Title("Cheese")
        Description {
          Text("You \(prefs.theyReallyLikeCheese ? "like" : "don't like") cheese.")
        }
      }
      .setColor(prefs.theyReallyLikeCheese ? .yellow : .red)
    }
  }
}
.integrationType(.all, contexts: .all)
.isUsableInDMS(true)
```

The `transaction` method is used to ensure that the data is not 
modified by another command while it is being modified by this one.
If another thread tries to modify the same data while the transaction is in 
progress, it will wait until the existing transaction is complete before modifying the data.

The reqs object is of type `DatabaseBranches`, which is a utility structure that 
contains all the predefined database requests based on interaction context.
